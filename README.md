Team VisionGuard developed AVA – Digital Voting Machine, an AI-powered voting system designed to improve election security and transparency using face recognition technology. The project was collaboratively built by Abhimanyu, who handled frontend development and user interface design; Naaneshwar, responsible for database handling and data management; Ajay, who managed backend development and system logic; and Ved, who conducted API testing and ensured smooth integration between system components. AVA authenticates voters through facial recognition before allowing them to cast a vote, ensuring fair and secure voting by preventing unauthorized access and duplicate voting. This project demonstrates the practical application of artificial intelligence, computer vision, and embedded systems using Raspberry Pi to build a reliable digital voting solution.
